        "problem": ["Generations of immigrant families have become disconnected due to the distance between them. There is currently no convenient way to preserve and share aspects of your life, language, and tradition with your family members. This generational disconnect is resulting in second-generation children losing sight of their heritage and feeling rootless as they try to balance the culture they have grown up in and the culture of their family members. Many family members, especially those who did not grow up together also have little to no knowledge of one another past the surface-level which further creates a gap. With online applications being the primary way to communicate long-distance, it can be difficult to know what to talk about, especially when you barely know the relative. Language barriers make it even harder to get to know someone online as you may have to have someone translate each conversation for you."],
        "solution": ["Our solution is a platform that helps immigrant families connect and preserve their traditions and culture. Prompty provides containers and prompts of ideas for what you can share so you and your family can grow your connections. With our platform, families can easily share their memories, recipes, songs, and more. They can even store family photos and videos in one convenient location. Our platform is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, even for those who are not tech-savvy."]

Some additional features include login, which allows users to bookmark and publish tourist spots. Bookmarking comes in handy because rather than keeping a tab open for each tourist spot, they can just save them to view later.

The prison population demographic is a reflection of racial inequality imposed by the prison industrial complex, disproportionately affecting African-American and Latinx communities specifically.",

        "Generational poverty persist from the era in which overt discrimination against minority groups confined them to poorly funded areas. Lower socioeconomic status is a high predictor of crime. Discrimination in the judicial system poses a threat as well. Not only do police arrest minorities at a higher rate, but African-Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans are more likely to be convicted, and to have longer sentences compared to their white counterparts. Such inequalities in the prison system strengthen racial stereotypes and lead to increased racial disparity. These stunt the growth of certain minority groups by limiting their opportunities as well as leaving them in less desirable socioeconomic situations. Hence, the cycle of poverty and crime continues.", 
        
        "This leads to our main problem statement: Which areas in the US show high incarceration rates, and in said areas, are African-American and Latino populations overrepresented? Among regions, states, and the different types of counties (categorized by their size), we intend to analyze which areas exemplify the most racial bias in incarceration.", 

        "The typical users of the database would be government and/or public service workers. Policymakers and government officials could use it as a springboard to investigate the issue in the hopes of reducing racial discrimination in incarceration. For example, they may place new policies to ensure that law enforcement does not overly target marginalized groups. Furthermore, they could direct more funding and support to underserved communities which have higher incarceration rates, therefore giving more access to social mobility and preventing the turn to crime in the first place. This data would be of interest to non-profit organizations and public health experts as well - high poverty and crime rates have adverse effects on public health, with inhabitants of the area being more prone to suffer from health problems and injuries.",
        
        "Some of the decisions that the aforementioned users will make based on the database will be as policy makers. Backed by data, they will be able to enact effective political change to reduce discrimination in the justice system. Data allows objective and quantitative viewing of discrepancies in society, which then helps validate marginalized experiences. Societal issues are less likely to be ignored with real data tailored to each community readily available. With new policies in effect, there will be a reduced incarceration rate, proportional to the U.S. population. Such effort will also further the cause of achieving racial justice for minority groups."]
